Description:
Academic Project for the course Computer Architecture and Design. The project is a MIPS architecture. The processor is based on 32-bit MIPS architecture. MIPS can handle three instruction formats of MIPS, R-type, I-type and J-types. As per the requirement of the project, the MIPS will be performing ten instructions: ADD, SUB, XOR, ANDI, SUBI, ADD, BEQ, LW, SW and JR. It will be assumed that the memory can be accessed in one clock cycle and works synchronously with the CPU and there is no provision for an external memory control
